      "requirement": "Update frontend/public/valentine.html to show a single Valentine question “Will you be my Valentine, my love?” with exactly two buttons (Yes/No), optimized for iPad Chrome, English-only copy.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement evasive “No” button behavior on frontend/public/valentine.html (hover/touch moves randomly within bounds and avoids overlapping Yes).",
