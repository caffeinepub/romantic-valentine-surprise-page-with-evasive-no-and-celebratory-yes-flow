Some requirements (exact prompt text / exactly-two-options) are not directly verifiable from the truncated diff, and one extra placeholder file appears unrelated to the request.",

      "reason": "The diff excerpts do not show the prompt view content in App.tsx (truncated before the initial view), and the standalone HTML snippet shows a title “Will You Be My Valentine? 💕”, which may indicate the question text is not the exact required string; the actual button markup/text is not visible in the provided truncation.",
